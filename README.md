# majority_element_algorithm
You are given an array of size n, which contains only integers. The array is not necessarily sorted. Write an algorithm to find the majority element in the array, if it exists. A majority element is defined as an element that appears more than n/2 times in the array. If no such element exists, your algorithm should indicate this.
